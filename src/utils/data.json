It reminds young readers that every person brings a valuable perspective to our world, making it a more vibrant and exciting place to live in. A sequel to Michael Rosenblum’s popular The Caterpillar and the Butterfly, in A Garden of Flowers we see the return of the butterfly Faith who helps bring understanding and peace to a squabbling garden. The book’s message is clear: we are ALL born as a special gift to teach each other about ourselves. The delightful full-page artwork accompanying the story adds a touch of magic, bringing to life the colorful world of flowers and their unique characteristics. The story acknowledges that just as every flower in a garden is different and beautiful, every person is beautifully unique and special in their own way. It teaches children the importance of accepting and celebrating differences and diversity, and how our differences make our world a dynamic and fascinating place to live in. After all, if all our colors were the same, we wouldn’t have rainbows.",

          "description": "A practical guide to using flowers in magical practice • Provides detailed instruction on every stage of the harvesting, crafting, and practical use of flower magic potions, including a comprehensive herbarium of all the flowers that may be used • Discusses what type of flower and form of flower magic is best for specific enchantments and rituals in the areas of love and sex magic, healing and focusing, and protection • Looks at the physical and spiritual gifts of bees and the importance of bee culture in Druidic flower magic Flowers are found in magic traditions around the world, from those in ancient Egypt, China, and India to the traditions of the Norse and Native Americans. Yet many of today’s well-established flower traditions—like bridal bouquets—originated in the Druidic magical lore of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. As fifth-generation Druid Jon G. Hughes explains, flowers hold a preeminent position in Druidic folk magic with their own special branch of magical workings. In this practical guide, Hughes details how to use flowers in magical practice, focusing on flowering plants with a long history of magical use going back to Druidic times yet many of which are commonly found throughout the world, such as buttercup, blackberry, and dog rose. He discusses what type of flower and form of flower magic is best for specific enchantments and rituals in the areas of love and sex magic, well-being and good fortune, and protection. He looks at the magical use of fresh flowers and provides detailed instruction on every stage of the harvesting, crafting, and practical use of flower magic potions, including a comprehensive herbarium of all the flowers that may be used. Examining the complex relationship between flowers and bees, the author looks at the physical and spiritual gifts of bees, such as honey, propolis, and beeswax, and the importance of bee culture in Druidic flower magic, including the tradition of the honeymoon, the significance of the hexagon, and medieval beekeeper lore. Inviting you into the gentle yet powerful realm of Druidic flower magic, the author also details how to plan, plant, and take care of your own magical flower garden with all the botanicals you will need to pursue the path of flower magic.",

The Encyclopedia of Cut Flowers dives deep into the world of fresh-cut flowers, featuring unique entries for 143 different varieties of commonly available cut flowers that readers can buy at their local grocery store or flower market. Each flower entry offers authoritative tips for conditioning methods (eg\u00ad–cut flowers should never be put near fresh fruit because fruit produces ethylene gas which will shorten the flowers' life), as well as scientific and common names, best seasons for buying (eg—lilies in spring, dahlias in summer) and fascinating facts about each bloom. An introductory section offers basic tips for styling arrangements at home, and for keeping flowers hydrated and alive for as long as possible. By the time readers are done flipping through the pages of The Encyclopedia of Cut Flowers, which features more than 150 gorgeous color photographs of flowers, they'll be experts in the field!",

Harvesting from the garden means short, wonky stems, bruised petals, insects crawling out of blooms and the open invitation to claim a weed or vege as vase fodder. Flowers for Friends is both a reflection, and story of the seasons brought indoors by Julia Atkinson-Dunn when harvesting from her garden and foraging in Canterbury, New Zealand. Written in her signature casual tone (as seen in her first book Petal Power), Julia offers an accessible guide to picking, conditioning and arranging home-grown treasures, celebrating their quirks and encouraging unexpected combinations. Seasonal chapters profile arrangements she has made, detailing plants in season and inviting readers to play without the hunt for perfection, or restraint.",
